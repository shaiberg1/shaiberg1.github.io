I am currently serving as the Chief Architect of Advanced Technologies at an exciting "stealth mode" startup company based in Haifa, Israel. Our research focuses include new memory and storage solutions, and involve exciting new technologies such as CXL.

I have finished my Ph.D. studies at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Mark Silberstein. I am interested in specialized hardware and accelerators, virtualization, memory management and algorithms.
